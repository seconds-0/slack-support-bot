Potential Future Plans (Beyond this V1):

If you wanted to expand further after completing and evaluating this V1, future plans could cover areas like:

PLAN-14-ScreenshotHandling: Detailing the specific logic to detect, retrieve, and potentially include screenshots in the "Log Incident" post.

PLAN-15-SlackSearchRAG: If deferred from Plan 8, explicitly integrating Slack message search results into the RAG context.

PLAN-16-AdvancedRAG: Implementing techniques like query transformation, re-ranking retrieved documents, or handling conflicting information.

PLAN-17-MonitoringAlerting: Setting up specific Cloud Monitoring dashboards and Alert Policies for the bot service and ingestion function.

PLAN-18-CICD: Implementing a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using Cloud Build triggers, GitHub Actions) for automated testing and deployment.

PLAN-19-ActionExecutionV2: Carefully designing and implementing the ability for the bot to take actions based on runbooks (the original V2 idea).

PLAN-20-BonusIntegrations: Adding integrations for querying logs, Grafana, or Kubernetes (the original Bonus features).
