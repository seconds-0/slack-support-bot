Thinking back to everything we've built is pretty crazy - I found this list of priorities from 2021! Look what we've done. Both of my children have been born during this tenure. I have made life-long friends and grown in ways I didn't even know was possible. I am so grateful for my time here.\n\nYou all are an incredible team, brimming with capability and drive and good hearts, and have the chance to make Fulfil the success it can be. Know that even as our paths diverge, I am cheering for you.\n\nIf there's anything I can do for you personally or professionally, please just reach out. Even years from now, I am happy to help you all wherever you are in your life journey, so if you're thinking about \"Should I message Alex?\", the answer is yes.\n\nThank you for the chance to build great stuff with you.

  "<@U04C3DEM4LF|Raynald - he-him - EDT>\n```# Property Naming Standardization Plan\n\n## Current State Assessment\n\nThe Ars Saga Manager application currently uses mixed naming conventions:\n\n- **Backend API** returns data with **snake_case** properties (character_type, has_the_gift, house_id)\n- **Frontend React components** traditionally use **camelCase** (characterType, hasTheGift, houseId)\n- Current codebase has accommodations for both styles, leading to complexity\n\n## Standardization Decision\n\nAfter careful analysis, the best approach is to:\n\n1. **Standardize on camelCase for all frontend code**\n2. **Create a data transformation layer at API boundaries**\n3. **Implement gradually to minimize disruption**\n\nThis approach:\n- Follows React/JavaScript conventions (camelCase)\n- Maintains clean separation between backend and frontend conventions\n- Allows for incremental implementation\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### 1. Create Transformation Utilities\n\nCreate a utility function in the API layer to transform snake_case to camelCase:\n\n```javascript\n// api/transform.js\nexport function camelizeKeys(obj) {\n  if (Array.isArray(obj)) {\n    return obj.map(v => camelizeKeys(v));\n  } else if (obj !== null &amp;&amp; obj.constructor === Object) {\n    return Object.keys(obj).reduce(\n      (result, key) => ({\n        ...result,\n        [camelCase(key)]: camelizeKeys(obj[key]),\n      }),\n      {},\n    );\n  }\n  return obj;\n}\n\nfunction camelCase(str) {\n  return str.replace(/_([a-z])/g, (_, letter) => letter.toUpperCase());\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Apply Transformation at API Boundaries\n\nModify the axios instance to automatically transform all responses:\n\n```javascript\n// api/axios.js\nimport axios from 'axios';\nimport { camelizeKeys } from './transform';\n\nconst api = axios.create({\n  baseURL: process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || '/api',\n  timeout: 10000,\n});\n\n// Response interceptor - transform all responses to camelCase\napi.interceptors.response.use(response => {\n  if (response.data) {\n    response.data = camelizeKeys(response.data);\n  }\n  return response;\n});\n\nexport default api;\n```\n\n### 3. Update Component Code\n\nThe update process will follow this pattern:\n\n1. New code will exclusively use camelCase\n2. Existing code will be updated as files are touched\n3. The dual property access pattern will be maintained during transition\n\n### 4. Documentation Updates\n\nUpdate CLAUDE.md with the standardized naming convention:\n\n```\n## Code Style Guidelines\n- **Property Naming**:\n  - All frontend property names should use camelCase\n  - API responses are transformed from snake_case to camelCase at the boundary\n  - Backend continues to use snake_case as per RESTful API conventions\n```\n\n### 5. Testing Strategy\n\n1. Add tests for the transformation utility\n2. Update existing tests to use camelCase consistently\n3. Add integration tests to verify API transformation works correctly\n\n## Implementation Timeline\n\n1. **Immediate (Current PR)**\n   - Create and implement the transformation utility\n   - Update existing dual-format code to prefer camelCase\n\n2. **Short-term (Next 2-3 PRs)**\n   - Update all component props and interfaces to camelCase\n   - Add tests for transformation utility\n\n3. **Ongoing**\n   - Convert remaining code as files are touched\n   - Remove dual-format checks once codebase is fully migrated\n\n## Benefits of This Approach\n\n1. **Developer Experience**: Follows JavaScript/React conventions\n2. **Code Clarity**: Removes need for dual property checks\n3. **Maintainability**: Single convention throughout frontend code\n4. **Gradual Migration**: Minimizes risk of breaking changes\n5. **Separation of Concerns**: Backend and frontend can maintain their own conventions\n\n## Decision Note\n\nThis standardization makes working with the codebase more predictable and maintainable. The transformation happens at the API boundary, which is an industry best practice, allowing both frontend and backend to use conventions appropriate to their languages/frameworks.```",
  "```## Project Overview\nArs Saga Manager is a character management system for Ars Magica tabletop RPG. The application allows users to create and manage characters with the following features:\n- Character creation with support for different types (Magus, Companion, Grog)\n- Virtues and Flaws system with validation rules\n- Character sheets with multiple tabs for attributes, abilities, and more\n- User authentication and character ownership\n\n## Memory Instructions\nWhen using /compact to clear conversation history, ALWAYS update memory.md with:\n- A timestamp\n- Summary of the conversation and work accomplished\n- List of files modified\n- Current status and next steps\n- Key decisions made\n\nReview memory.md at the start of each new session to maintain context between conversations.\n\n## Task Planning and Execution System\n\n### Workplan Creation\nBefore implementing any feature or bugfix:\n1. Create a dedicated workplan file in the `Documentation/Plans/` directory with naming format: `TaskID-Description.md` (e.g., `BUG-AuthFlow.md`, `FEAT-Abilities.md`)\n2. Workplan structure must include:\n   - **Task ID**: Simple identifier for reference (e.g., \"FEAT-Abilities\", \"BUG-AuthFlow\")\n   - **Problem Statement**: Clear definition of what needs to be solved or implemented\n   - **Components Involved**: Related areas of the system (broader than just files)\n   - **Dependencies**: Prerequisite knowledge, components, or systems needed\n   - **Implementation Checklist**: Step-by-step tasks with checkboxes\n   - **Verification Steps**: How to confirm the implementation works correctly\n   - **Decision Authority**: Clarify which decisions you can make independently vs which require user input\n   - **Questions/Uncertainties**:\n      - *Blocking*: Issues that must be resolved before proceeding\n      - *Non-blocking*: Issues you can make reasonable assumptions about and proceed\n   - **Acceptable Tradeoffs**: What compromises are acceptable for implementation speed\n   - **Status**: One of [Not Started, In Progress, Completed, Blocked]\n   - **Notes**: Any implementation decisions, challenges, or context for future reference\n\n### Workplan Execution\n1. Update the workplan Status from \"Not Started\" to \"In Progress\" when you begin implementation\n2. Check off items in the checklist as they are completed\n3. Add notes about implementation decisions or challenges encountered\n4. For non-blocking uncertainties:\n   - Document your working assumption\n   - Proceed with implementation based on that assumption\n   - Flag the assumption in the Notes section for future review\n5. For blocking uncertainties:\n   - Document the specific question or issue\n   - Update status to \"Blocked\" if you cannot proceed\n   - Once resolved, document the resolution and continue\n6. Update the Status to \"Completed\" once all steps are finished and verified\n\n### Memory Integration\n1. After completing a workplan, update memory.md with:\n   - Reference to the workplan: \"Executed <Workplan Task ID>\"\n   - Brief summary of implementation results\n   - Any notable challenges or decisions made\n2. When reviewing memory.md, check referenced workplans for detailed context on previous work\n\n## Build/Test/Lint Commands\n- Backend: `cd backend &amp;&amp; npm run dev` - Start development server\n- Frontend: `cd frontend &amp;&amp; npm start` - Start React app\n- Run all tests: `npm run test:all` - Run all tests in backend and frontend\n- Run single test: `cd frontend &amp;&amp; npm test -- -t \"test name\"` or `cd backend &amp;&amp; npm test -- -t \"test name\"`\n- Frontend test with HTML report: `cd frontend &amp;&amp; npm run test:html` - Generates test-report.html\n- Start all services: `npm run start:all` - Start backend, frontend, and logging stack\n- Stop all services: `npm run stop:all` - Gracefully shut down all services\n- Health check: `npm run health` - Check status of all services\n\n## Testing Environment Options\n\nThe project provides multiple ways to run tests, each with different performance characteristics:\n\n### 1. Batched Test Runner (WSL)\nFor running tests in WSL with batching to mitigate timeouts:\n\n- Run all tests in batches: `npm run test:batched`\n- Run only frontend tests: `npm run test:batched:frontend`\n- Run only backend tests: `npm run test:batched:backend`\n- Run tests for recently changed files: `npm run test:changed`\n\nAdditional options:\n- Set batch size: `npm run test:batched -- --batch-size=3`\n- Filter tests by pattern: `npm run test:batched -- --pattern=VirtueFlaw`\n- See detailed output: `npm run test:batched -- --verbose`\n\nThe batched test runner creates a detailed Markdown report in `/test-results/batched-test-report.md` with:\n- Test summary statistics\n- Detailed error information for failing tests\n- Batch execution metadata\n\n### 2. Docker-based Testing (Recommended)\nFor optimal performance, the Docker-based test runner provides isolated environment with better performance:\n\n- Run all tests in Docker: `npm run test:docker`\n- Build and run tests: `npm run test:docker:build`\n- Run only frontend tests: `npm run test:docker:frontend`\n- Run only backend tests: `npm run test:docker:backend`\n- Run tests for specific file pattern: `npm run test:docker:file=src/components/*.test.js`\n\nBenefits of Docker testing:\n- Consistent environment across machines\n- Significantly faster than WSL\n- Avoids Windows filesystem performance issues\n- Isolated dependencies from host system\n\n### 3. WSL Optimization\nTo improve WSL performance, run the optimization script:\n\n```\nnpm run test:wsl-optimize\n```\n\nThis script:\n- Creates optimal .wslconfig in Windows home directory\n- Adjusts Linux memory and swap settings\n- Configures disk I/O optimizations\n- Sets up Node.js memory optimizations\n\nAfter running, restart WSL with `wsl --shutdown` from PowerShell.\n\n### 4. Simple Test Runner (Fastest)\nFor ultra-fast testing during development, the simple test runner bypasses Jest entirely:\n\n```\nnpm run test:simple path/to/test.js\n```\n\nThe simple test runner:\n- Uses pure Node.js, avoiding Jest's overhead\n- Supports basic Jest API (test/describe/expect)\n- Runs in milliseconds instead of minutes\n- Perfect for quick validation of logic\n- Limitations: no UI component testing, limited matchers\n\nExample test file:\n```javascript\ntest('addition works', () => {\n  expect(1 + 1).toBe(2);\n});\n\ndescribe('Array methods', () => {\n  test('map works', () => {\n    const arr = [1, 2, 3];\n    const result = arr.map(x => x * 2);\n    expect(result).toEqual([2, 4, 6]);\n  });\n});\n```\n\nThis option is ideal for quickly validating business logic, utilities, and other non-UI code during development.\n\n## Code Style Guidelines\n- **Naming**:\n  - Variables/functions: camelCase (e.g., `handleSubmit`, `userData`)\n  - Components/classes: PascalCase (e.g., `CharacterSheet`, `LoadingSpinner`)\n  - Test files: Same name as component with `.test.js` suffix\n  - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for true constants (e.g., `VALID_CHARACTER_TYPES`)\n  - API properties: camelCase in frontend code, snake_case in backend/API\n    - API responses automatically transformed snake_case → camelCase at boundary\n    - API requests automatically transformed camelCase → snake_case at boundary\n\n- **Imports**: Group in this order with blank line separators:\n  1. React and hooks\n  2. Third-party libraries\n  3. Project components/utilities\n\n- **Component Structure**:\n  - Functional components with hooks\n  - Props destructuring at the top\n  - State declarations next\n  - Effect hooks\n  - Event handlers\n  - Helper functions\n  - Return statement with JSX\n\n- **State Management**:\n  - React Query for server state\n  - Local state with useState for UI state\n  - Custom hooks for reusable state logic (e.g., `useVirtuesAndFlaws`, `useAuth`)\n\n- **Testing Guidelines**:\n  - Use the standardized test file structure from TEST-STANDARDIZATION.md\n  - Include setup function with this pattern:\n    ```javascript\n    function setup(customProps = {}) {\n      const defaultProps = { /* Default props */ };\n      const props = { ...defaultProps, ...customProps };\n      const utils = render(<Component {...props} />);\n      return { ...utils, mockFn: props.mockFn, props };\n    }\n    ```\n  - Suppress console errors with this pattern:\n    ```javascript\n    const originalError = console.error;\n    beforeAll(() => {\n      console.error = jest.fn((message) => {\n        if (message.includes('specific warning')) return;\n        originalError.call(console, message);\n      });\n    });\n    ```\n  - Group tests with descriptive describe blocks (Rendering, User interactions, Edge cases)\n  - Focus on testing behavior, not implementation details\n  - Use data-testid selectors for reliable DOM interaction\n  - Mock dependencies appropriately and consistently between tests\n  - Reset mocks between tests with beforeEach/afterEach\n  - Only use waitFor() for truly async operations\n  - Test files should be colocated with components```",

When reviewing memory.md, check referenced workplans for detailed context on previous work\n\n## Build/Test/Lint Commands\n- Backend: `cd backend &amp;&amp; npm run dev` - Start development server\n- Frontend: `cd frontend &amp;&amp; npm start` - Start React app\n- Run all tests: `npm run test:all` - Run all tests in backend and frontend\n- Run single test: `cd frontend &amp;&amp; npm test -- -t \"test name\"` or `cd backend &amp;&amp; npm test -- -t \"test name\"`\n- Frontend test with HTML report: `cd frontend &amp;&amp; npm run test:html` - Generates test-report.html\n- Start all services: `npm run start:all` - Start backend, frontend, and logging stack\n- Stop all services: `npm run stop:all` - Gracefully shut down all services\n- Health check: `npm run health` - Check status of all services\n\n## Code Style Guidelines\n- **Naming**:\n  - Variables/functions: camelCase (e.g., `handleSubmit`, `userData`)\n  - Components/classes: PascalCase (e.g., `CharacterSheet`, `LoadingSpinner`)\n  - Test files: Same name as component with `.test.js` suffix\n  - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for true constants (e.g., `VALID_CHARACTER_TYPES`)\n\n- **Imports**: Group in this order with blank line separators:\n  1. React and hooks\n  2. Third-party libraries\n  3. Project components/utilities\n\n- **Component Structure**:\n  - Functional components with hooks\n  - Props destructuring at the top\n  - State declarations next\n  - Effect hooks\n  - Event handlers\n  - Helper functions\n  - Return statement with JSX\n\n- **State Management**:\n  - React Query for server state\n  - Local state with useState for UI state\n  - Custom hooks for reusable state logic (e.g., `useVirtuesAndFlaws`, `useAuth`)\n\n- **Testing Guidelines**:\n  - Use setup functions with consistent configuration\n  - Group tests with descriptive describe blocks (Rendering, User interactions, API calls, etc.)\n  - Focus on testing behavior, not implementation details\n  - Mock dependencies appropriately\n  - Only use waitFor() for truly async operations\n  - Suppress console logs during tests\n  - Add console log/error spies in beforeEach/afterEach\n  - Test files colocated with components\n  - Use `data-testid` attributes for test selectors\n  - Test async with waitFor\n  - Test user interactions with fireEvent or userEvent\n\n## Unit Testing Best Practices\n\n### Test Structure\n- Begin each test file with standard imports and mock setup\n- Group tests using descriptive describe blocks (Rendering, Interactions, Error handling, etc.)\n- Use consistent setup functions for component rendering\n- Test behavior, not implementation details\n\n### Component Testing Checklist\n- Initial render state verification\n- Props handling and propagation\n- User interactions (clicks, inputs, form submission)\n- Conditional rendering paths\n- Error states and messages\n- Loading states\n- Empty/null state handling\n- Accessibility concerns\n\n### Mock Guidelines\n- Mock all external dependencies (API calls, hooks, context)\n- Use consistent mock patterns across files\n- Reset mocks between tests with beforeEach/afterEach\n- Document complex mocks with comments\n\n### Test Organization for Complex Components\n- **Structure:**\n  - Organize test files to mirror component hierarchy\n  - For large components, split tests into logical sections with separate describe blocks\n  - Create dedicated test files for complex subcomponents\n  - Use a consistent naming pattern: `ComponentName.test.js` and `ComponentName.integration.test.js`\n\n- **Shared Resources:**\n  - Create `__test-utils__` directories for shared fixtures and helpers\n  - Extract common setup functions into reusable utilities\n  - Build mock factories for commonly tested data structures\n  - Document test fixtures with comments explaining their purpose\n\n- **Refactoring Existing Tests:**\n  - Identify and extract repeated setup code into helper functions\n  - Split monolithic test files into dedicated context-specific files\n  - Move common mock configurations to shared setup files\n  - Add explicit describe blocks to group related tests\n\n### Testing Complex State Management\n- **Hook Testing Strategy:**\n  - Create separate test files for custom hooks: `useCustomHook.test.js`\n  - Test hooks in isolation using `renderHook` from Testing Library\n  - Verify all state transitions with explicit assertions\n  - Test effect cleanup functions to prevent memory leaks\n\n- **Component State Testing:**\n  - Test each distinct state representation in the UI\n  - Verify state transitions triggered by user interactions\n  - Test asynchronous state updates with appropriate waiting patterns\n  - Ensure error states are properly represented in the UI\n\n- **Refactoring Existing Tests:**\n  - Extract state management testing into dedicated hook tests\n  - Add missing tests for state transition edge cases\n  - Add explicit tests for async loading/error states\n  - Document complex state flows with test comments\n\n### Testing Error Boundaries and Recovery\n- **Error Boundary Testing:**\n  - Create dedicated tests for error boundary components\n  - Test both error and non-error rendering paths\n  - Verify error details are appropriately displayed/logged\n  - Test recovery mechanisms (retries, resets, fallbacks)\n\n- **Component Error Testing:**\n  - Add explicit tests that trigger component errors\n  - Verify fallback UI rendering when errors occur\n  - Test that errors are properly contained and don't cascade\n  - Verify error reporting mechanisms work correctly\n\n- **Refactoring Existing Tests:**\n  - Add error boundary tests for components missing them\n  - Review error states in existing components and add missing tests\n  - Implement consistent error simulation techniques\n  - Document expected error behavior in test descriptions\n\n### Balancing Test Coverage and Maintenance\n- **Coverage Strategy:**\n  - **Core Business Logic:** 90%+ coverage\n  - **UI Components:** Focus on key user interactions and rendering paths\n  - **Utility Functions:** 100% coverage\n  - **Configuration/Constants:** Minimal testing\n\n- **Optimizing Test Efficiency:**\n  - Use parameterized tests for similar scenarios\n  - Test behaviors, not implementation details\n  - Limit snapshot testing to stable components\n  - Group related assertions to minimize test runs\n\n- **Sustainable Maintenance:**\n  - Update tests when component behavior changes\n  - Delete tests for removed functionality\n  - Document complex test setups with comments\n  - Mark explicitly ignored tests with reasons\n\n- **Refactoring Existing Tests:**\n  - Identify over-tested areas and simplify\n  - Add missing tests for critical functionality\n  - Convert imperative test sequences to declarative assertions\n  - Add JSDoc comments for test intent and coverage decisions\n\n### Basic Usability Testing\n- Verify interactive elements (buttons, links) function properly\n- Ensure form elements can be completed and submitted\n- Test that error messages are visible and understandable\n- Use data-testid attributes for stable test selectors\n\n### Performance Considerations\n- Add specific tests for expensive operations\n- Test memo/callback optimizations actually prevent rerenders\n- Test lazy-loaded components render correctly\n\n### Test Maintenance\n- Colocate tests with components\n- Update tests with component changes\n- Avoid brittle selectors dependent on DOM structure\n- Document test assumptions in comments\n\n- **Error Handling**:\n  - Frontend: Component error states and ErrorBoundary\n  - Backend: AppError class with isOperational flag\n  - Consistent error response structure: `{ status, message }`\n\n- **Validation**:\n  - Frontend: Form validation with error messages\n  - Backend: Joi schemas for request validation (see `backend/middleware/validation.js`)\n  - Domain-specific rules in validation utilities (see `virtueFlawValidation.js`)\n  - Input sanitization middleware (see `backend/middleware/sanitizer.js`)\n\n- **Styling**:\n  - Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling\n  - Theme extensions in tailwind.config.js with medieval-themed colors\n  - Responsive design patterns with mobile-first approach\n  - Use of Flowbite components when appropriate\n\n- **API Responses**:\n  - Standard format: `{ status, data }` for success, `{ status, message }` for errors\n  - HTTP status codes matching response content\n  - Structured error messages for validation failures```",
  "<@U03P6LT82Q4|John Biscay> this sounds like a metadata change rather than something that came from Amazon right?\n\n<@UNFQUGUS3|Tony> <@U015EQS4HT4|Zach Boone> - does it make sense / is it feasible that when a user makes a change on PIM for something like this, we could show them how many trays it would affect and, at a minimum, preemptively communicate this?\n\nAdditionally, is there possible logging for us to think of when adding the blocked condition for the triggering reason?",
  "My theory was that the amazon team had the wrong layer on tons of items and needed to update them, changing their layer, which then results a bunch of stuff shifting, but from what youve said i doubt that causes blocks",
  "This sounds like something I am powerless to help with but if theres anything please ping me, ill be up for a while",
  "Ah, terrible, ok not what I thought it was",

Once the other underlying api work is done, thats pretty easy",
  "It could also be on your side where you guys look at the order that comes in, hit the ICQA / cleaning queue endpoint or check the inventory api, then see what might be blocked",
  "For POC if you want someone on the technical team for literal events to action, put it in the channel and tag me and lobato for easiest conversation starter. I think that would be the first place.\n\nThere is a possibility that the ideal workflow happens within Fulfil - upon order place, cloud checks the inventory that you ordered, see if anything is blocked from fulfilling by holds, then emits some kind of \"Do Now\" alert to try and satisfy the order. That doesnt exist today",

  "```\"timestampFormat\": \"{{ date }} ({{ timezone }})\"```\nAnd then use this in the templates.\nWait, actually, since the time zone is specific to each timestamp, it's probably better to handle it in the component logic rather than in translations.\nBut for labels like \"Start Date (Time Zone)\", the time zone might be included in the translation.\nStep 20: Finalize the implementation guide.\nOnce I have all the details, I can structure the guide with sections like:\n• Introduction: Explain the purpose of the feature.\n• Identifying Components: List the components that display timestamps.\n• Fetching Time Zones: Describe how to fetch the time zone for a given facility or vendor store.\n• Formatting Timestamps: Explain how to convert and format the timestamp with the time zone.\n• Updating Components: Provide examples of how to update specific components.\n• Handling Edge Cases: Describe how to handle missing time zone information or other edge cases.\n• Testing: Outline the testing strategy.\n• Performance Considerations: Discuss any performance implications and optimizations.\nI think that covers the main points.\nWait, one more thing: since the application supports multiple languages, I need to ensure that the date formatting respects the locale.\nFor example, in English, the date might be \"October 5, 2023\", while in Spanish, it's \"5 de octubre de 2023\".\nSo, when formatting the date, I need to use the appropriate locale.\nAngular's DatePipe can handle locales, so I should make sure to pass the correct locale when formatting dates.\nAlso, for the time zone name, as I mentioned earlier, it's probably fine to display it in English, but I should confirm if there's a requirement to translate it.\nAssuming not, I can proceed.\nAlright, I think I have a solid plan for the implementation guide.\nTo summarize:\n• Identify all components displaying timestamps.\n• For each, determine how to get the associated facility or vendor store.\n• Fetch the time zone using a service.\n• Convert the UTC timestamp to the local time using the time zone.\n• Format the local time according to the user's locale and append the time zone.\n• Update the UI to display the formatted timestamp with time zone.\n• Handle cases where time zone information is missing.\n• Optimize for performance if necessary.\n• Update tests and documentation accordingly.\nI believe this covers the requirements. If there are any specific questions or areas that need clarification, please let me know.\nNo questions at this time. The plan seems comprehensive.",
  "Okay, so I have this task to design an implementation guide for a feature in the Remote Tray Audit tool. The feature is about displaying time zones along with timestamps wherever they appear in the application. Since the app spans multiple time zones, it's crucial to show the correct time zone for each timestamp, which can be determined based on the vendor store and facility's time zone.\nFirst, I need to understand what the Remote Tray Audit tool is. From the name, it sounds like a tool used to audit or monitor trays remotely, possibly in a warehouse or logistics setting, given the context of the repository. Trays might be containers holding items, and auditing them could involve checking their status, contents, or other attributes at specific times.\nNow, the task is to find all places in the application where timestamps are displayed and append the corresponding time zone. The time zone should be the local time zone where the image (or the event) took place, which can be fetched through the vendor store and facility associated with that event.\nLet me think about how to approach this.\nStep 1: Identify all components or modules in the application where timestamps are displayed.\nGiven the directory structure provided earlier, I can look for components that are likely to display timestamps. For example:\n• In the induction module, there might be components showing when a tray was loaded or audited.\n• In the delivery-dashboard, there could be timestamps for delivery events.\n• In the faults module, timestamps for when faults occurred or were reported.\n• In logs or history views, such as dispense-logs, there are probably timestamps for each log entry.\nI should systematically go through each module and component to identify where timestamps are being displayed.\nStep 2: Determine how timestamps are currently being handled.\nAre they stored in UTC and then converted to local time? Or are they stored in the local time of the facility? I need to understand the current timestamp management to know how to append the correct time zone.\nFrom the translation files, I see references to time zones, like in faults-filter:\n\n\n```\n\"startDateLabel\": \"Start({{ timezone }})\",\n\n\"endDateLabel\": \"End({{ timezone }})\"```\nThis suggests that time zones are already being considered in some parts of the application, at least for filtering faults.\nSimilarly, in nav-list, there's:\n\n\n```\"dashboardVersion\": \"dashboard: {{ currentVersion }}\",\n\n\"frapiVersion\": \"frapi: {{ frapiVersion }}\",```\nBut this doesn't directly relate to timestamps.\nI need to find out how timestamps are formatted and displayed across the application.\nStep 3: Fetch the time zone based on vendor store and facility.\nThe task mentions that the time zone can usually be found through the vendor store and facility. So, for each timestamp, there should be an associated vendor store or facility, which has a time zone attached.\nI need to ensure that for every timestamp displayed, I can retrieve the corresponding facility or vendor store's time zone.\nThis might involve:\n• Associating each event or record with a facility or vendor store.\n• Having a service or utility function that can fetch the time zone based on the facility or vendor store ID.\nFor example, there might be a FacilityService or VendorStoreService that provides the time zone for a given ID.\nStep 4: Modify the timestamp display to include the time zone.\nOnce I have the time zone, I need to append it to the timestamp. The format could be something like \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss (Time Zone)\", for example, \"2023-10-05 14:30:00 (America/New_York)\".\nI need to decide on a consistent format across the application.\nAlso, I should consider whether to display the time zone abbreviation (e.g., EST) or the full name (e.g., Eastern Standard Time), or the offset (e.g., UTC-5). Using the full time zone name might be more precise, as abbreviations can be ambiguous.\nStep 5: Handle cases where the time zone cannot be determined.\nThere might be scenarios where the facility or vendor store is not specified, or the time zone information is missing. In such cases, I need to decide how to handle the display. Perhaps show \"Unknown\" or \"UTC\" as a fallback.\nStep 6: Update the UI components.\nFor each component that displays a timestamp, I need to:\n• Retrieve the associated facility or vendor store.\n• Fetch the time zone.\n• Format the timestamp with the time zone.\nThis might involve updating templates (HTML files) to include the time zone, and possibly modifying component TypeScript files to fetch and pass the time zone.\nStep 7: Consider performance implications.\nIf fetching the time zone involves API calls, and there are many timestamps on a page, this could lead to performance issues. To mitigate this, I might need to cache time zone information or fetch it in bulk.\nFor example, if multiple timestamps on a page belong to the same facility, I can fetch the time zone once and reuse it.\nStep 8: Update tests.\nSince the application has extensive testing, I need to update the tests to account for the new time zone display. This includes updating mock data to include time zones and adjusting assertions in tests.\nStep 9: Document the changes.\nIn the implementation guide, I should document:\n• Which components were updated.\n• How the time zone is fetched and displayed.\n• Any new services or utilities created.\n• How to handle cases where time zone information is missing.\n• Performance considerations and optimizations.\nStep 10: Provide examples.\nIt would be helpful to include examples in the guide, showing before and after for a few components, to illustrate how the timestamp display has changed.\nFor instance:\nBefore: \"故障时间: 2023-10-05 14:30:00\"\nAfter: \"故障时间: 2023-10-05 14:30:00 (America/New_York)\"\nWait, that's in Chinese. Since the app supports multiple languages, I need to ensure that the time zone display is appropriately localized if necessary. However, time zone names are typically not translated, so it might be fine to display them in English.\nBut I should confirm if there's a requirement to translate time zone names.\nStep 11: Consider user preferences.\nIs there a need to allow users to select their preferred time zone for display? The task specifies to use the local time zone where the image took place, so probably not. But it's worth confirming.\nStep 12: Review existing code for time zone handling.\nI should check if there are already mechanisms in place for handling time zones, perhaps in the core services or in date formatting utilities.\nFor example, there might be a DatePipe or a custom pipe for formatting dates with time zones.\nStep 13: Implement a utility function for formatting timestamps with time zones.\nTo ensure consistency, I could create a utility function or a pipe that takes a timestamp and a time zone, and returns the formatted string with the time zone appended.\nFor example:\n\n\n```formatTimestamp(timestamp: Date, timezone: string): string {\n\n  // Format the timestamp in the given time zone\n\n  const formattedDate = // use a library like date-fns-tz to format\n\n  return `${formattedDate} (${timezone})`;\n\n}```\nWait, actually, since the timestamp is likely stored in UTC, I might need to convert it to the facility's time zone before displaying.\nBut the task is to append the time zone, not necessarily to convert the timestamp. Wait, actually, in the translation files, for faults-filter, it shows \"Start({{ timezone }})\", which might imply that the date is displayed in that time zone.\nI need to clarify: should the timestamp be displayed in the facility's local time, or in UTC with the time zone appended?\nLooking back at the task: \"append the timezone. Note that this apps spans numerous timezones, so it will need to fetch the local timezone of where the image took place.\"\nIt says \"append the timezone,\" but it doesn't specify whether to convert the timestamp to local time or keep it in UTC.\nHowever, in user interfaces, it's common to display timestamps in the local time of the event, especially if the application spans multiple time zones.\nFor example, if an event happened at a facility in New York at 14:30 local time, it should be displayed as \"14:30 (America/New_York)\", not as the UTC time.\nSo, I think the intention is to display the timestamp in the local time of the facility, with the time zone appended.\nTo confirm, let's look at the existing code or documentation, but since I don't have access to the code, I'll assume that's the case.\nTherefore, for each timestamp, I need to:\n1. Determine the facility or vendor store associated with the event.\n2. Fetch the time zone of that facility.\n3. Convert the timestamp (which is likely in UTC) to the facility's local time.\n4. Format the local time and append the time zone.\nStep 14: Choose a library for time zone handling.\nAngular's built-in DatePipe supports time zones, but it might be limited. I might need a more robust library like date-fns-tz or luxon for better time zone support.\nI should check if the application already uses a date library.\nStep 15: Update the implementation guide accordingly.\nIn the guide, I need to specify:\n• How to determine the facility or vendor store for each timestamp.\n• How to fetch the time zone.\n• How to convert and format the timestamp.\n• How to handle cases where the time zone is unknown.\n• Any performance optimizations.\nStep 16: Consider the data model.\nI need to ensure that each record or event that has a timestamp also has a reference to the facility or vendor store.\nFor example, in the database or API responses, does each event include a facilityId or vendorStoreId?\nIf not, I might need to find another way to associate the event with a time zone.\nStep 17: Handle time zone changes.\nTime zones can change due to daylight saving time. I need to ensure that the time zone library handles this correctly.\nFor example, if an event happened during daylight saving time, it should be displayed with the correct offset.\nStep 18: Test the implementation.\nI should include in the guide how to test the feature, including:\n• Testing with different time zones.\n• Testing with events that span daylight saving time changes.\n• Testing with missing time zone information.\nStep 19: Update documentation and translations.\nIf the time zone is displayed in the UI, I might need to update the translation files to include the time zone in the appropriate places.\nFor example, in en.json, I might have:",

  "Answer to User Query: Appending Time Zone Indicators to Timestamps\nBased on your query and clarifications, I’ll provide a clear and actionable response to append time zone indicators (e.g., EST, PST) to the displayed timestamps in the Remote Tray Audit tool. Here’s the complete solution tailored to your requirements.\n\n\nUnderstanding the Problem\nYou’ve clarified that:\n1. Stored Timestamps: These are in UTC.\n2. Displayed Timestamps: These are already converted to local time (assumed to be the facility’s local time). You don’t know exactly how this conversion happens, but the displayed times are correct.\n3. Goal: Append the appropriate time zone indicator (e.g., EST) to the existing displayed timestamps to clarify the time zone for users.\n4. Scope: No need to modify the timestamp conversion logic—only append the indicator.\n5. Existing Service: There’s a service to fetch facility time zones.\n6. Language: Use English time zone names (e.g., EST, PST).\n7. Formatting: No specific preferences beyond appending the indicator.\nThe task is straightforward: since the displayed timestamps are already correct, we just need to fetch the facility’s time zone and append its abbreviation to the display.\n\n\nStep-by-Step Solution\nHere’s how to implement this:\n1. Identify Where Timestamps Are Displayed\n• What to Do: Find all UI components in the codebase that show timestamps.\n• How to Do It:\n    ◦ Search for terms like date, timestamp, or time in templates (e.g., .html files).\n    ◦ Look for Angular DatePipe usage (e.g., {{ event.timestamp | date }}) or custom display logic.\n• Likely components include:\n        ▪︎ induction-list.component.html (Induction module)\n        ▪︎ delivery-dashboard.component.html (Delivery Dashboard)\n        ▪︎ faults-list.component.html (Faults)\n    ◦ dispense-logs.component.html (Dispense Logs)\n    ◦ Make a list of these components for reference.\n2. Confirm Current Display Logic (Optional but Recommended)\n• What to Do: Quickly verify how timestamps are currently displayed to ensure they’re in the facility’s local time.\n• How to Do It:\n    ◦ Check a sample component (e.g., faults-list.component.ts/html).\n    ◦ Look at the data property (e.g., event.timestamp or event.displayTime).\n    ◦ If it’s a string like \"2023-10-05 14:30:00\", it’s likely pre-formatted in local time.\n    ◦ If it’s a Date object with | date pipe, it might be using the browser’s time zone (which could be wrong). Since you’ve confirmed the times are correct, assume it’s already facility-local.\n• Note: You don’t need to fix the conversion—just confirm the assumption. If unsure, proceed assuming the display is correct per your clarification.\n3. Fetch Facility Time Zones\n• What to Do: Use the existing service to get the time zone for each facility.\n• How to Do It:\n    ◦ Identify the service (e.g., FacilityService) that provides time zone data.\n    ◦ Each timestamp should be tied to a facility (e.g., event.facilityId or event.facility.timeZone).\n    ◦ The service likely returns a time zone identifier like America/New_York.\n4. Create a Utility Function for Time Zone Abbreviations\n• What to Do: Write a function to convert the time zone identifier into a short abbreviation (e.g., EST).\n• How to Do It:\n    ◦ Use JavaScript’s Intl.DateTimeFormat API for simplicity and accuracy.\nHere’s the code:\ntypescript\n\n\n```// src/app/utils/date-utils.ts\nexport function getTimeZoneAbbreviation(timeZone: string): string {\n  const date = new Date();\n  const options: Intl.DateTimeFormatOptions = { timeZone, timeZoneName: 'short' };\n  const formatter = new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US', options);\n  const parts = formatter.formatToParts(date);\n  const timeZonePart = parts.find(part => part.type === 'timeZoneName');\n  return timeZonePart ? timeZonePart.value : timeZone; // Fallback to full name if abbreviation fails\n}```\n• Explanation:\n    ◦ Takes a time zone like America/New_York.\n    ◦ Returns EST or EDT depending on the date and DST.\n    ◦ Handles edge cases by falling back to the full time zone name.\n5. Update Components to Append the Indicator\n• What to Do: Modify each component to show the timestamp with its time zone abbreviation.\n• How to Do It:\n    ◦ Assume the timestamp is a pre-formatted string (e.g., event.displayTime).\n    ◦ Add the abbreviation in parentheses.\nExample Component\nTypeScript (faults-list.component.ts):\ntypescript\n\n\n```import { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport { getTimeZoneAbbreviation } from '../utils/date-utils';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-faults-list',\n  templateUrl: './faults-list.component.html'\n})\nexport class FaultsListComponent {\n  events: any[] = []; // Populated with data including facility.timeZone\n\n  // Optional: Method to combine timestamp and abbreviation\n  getDisplayTimeWithZone(event: any): string {\n    const timeZone = event.facility?.timeZone || 'UTC'; // Default to UTC if missing\n    const abbreviation = getTimeZoneAbbreviation(timeZone);\n    return `${event.displayTime} (${abbreviation})`;\n  }\n}```\nHTML (faults-list.component.html):\nhtml\n\n\n```<td>{{ getDisplayTimeWithZone(event) }}</td>```\nOR directly in the template:\nhtml\n\n\n```<td>{{ event.displayTime }} ({{ getTimeZoneAbbreviation(event.facility.timeZone || 'UTC') }})</td>```\n• Notes:\n    ◦ Use event.facility.timeZone || 'UTC' to handle missing data.\n    ◦ If event.displayTime isn’t a string but a Date object, let me know—we’d need to format it first.\n6. Handle Edge Cases\n• Missing Data:\n    ◦ If facility or timeZone is missing, default to UTC as shown above.\n• DST Transitions:\n    ◦ The Intl API automatically adjusts for DST (e.g., EST vs. EDT).\n• Performance:\n    ◦ If the time zone service involves API calls, consider caching results in the component or service layer.\n7. Test the Changes\n• What to Do: Verify the implementation works as expected.\n• How to Do It:\n• Test Cases:\n        ▪︎ Event in America/New_York → Displays \"2023-10-05 14:30:00 (EST)\" (or EDT if DST).\n        ▪︎ Event in America/Los_Angeles → Displays \"2023-10-05 11:30:00 (PST)\".\n    ◦ Event with no facility → Displays \"2023-10-05 18:30:00 (UTC)\".\n• Steps:\n        ▪︎ Mock data with different facilities and time zones.\n        ▪︎ Check during DST transition dates (e.g., March or November 2023).\n    ◦ Inspect a few components in the UI.\n\nFinal Notes\n• Assumption: The displayed timestamps (event.displayTime) are strings in the facility’s local time. If they’re Date objects or UTC strings, we’d need a library like date-fns-tz to convert them—let me know if this is the case.\n• Scope: Per your constraint, I’ve avoided altering the timestamp conversion logic and focused solely on appending the indicator.\n• Next Steps: Apply this pattern to all components from Step 1.\nThis solution should meet your needs, making timestamps unambiguous for users by showing the correct facility time zone indicator. If you need help with a specific component or find the display logic differs from my assumptions, feel free to provide more details!",

  "RE 5 bots assigned to purge - I spoke with Chris on this implementation. The purge limit is a target for the system to balance towards. You can think of it as an approximate maximum cap on the long-term average number of bots assigned to purge orders. It can be temporarily exceeded when some purge bots are almost done.\n\nSince customer orders are handled by the same planner, you can also think of it as a guarantee that all bots except for N are freed up for customer orders. If it so happens that there are no customer orders, though, the plan execution is free to grab extra bots a bit sooner than you'd expect.\n\nThis is due to how the factory plans in large periods while still allowing greedy path optimization at the individual bot level. This is about as hard as we want to constrain the factory.\n\ncc <@W017GG59GCW> / <@W018CNBJHEC> / <@W017PVAAVBM> / <@W017WPG7TFT>",

The new document places responsibility on Fulfil to prevent \"Bag Full\" situations through cartonization, making it a requirement on Fulfil to ensure 100% cartonization accuracy",

We then evaluate what products are available / eligible. If there are no products in the order are valid to order for any combination of reasons (ASINs dont exist, no inventory in the facility at all, products are offboarded) then the order will immediately short.\n\nNote, if any offboarded inventory remains in the Fulfil system, it is not automatically flagged for removal by Fulfil; it is Amazons choice per Pack Requirement 18\n\n```1. If Amazon have removed an item from the catalog that is synchronized to Fulfil, and there is still some of this inventory within the automation system, it will still be dispensed if required for any order (existing or new), and still follow expiration purge requirements \n\n2. If Amazon choose to purge the item, they will call an API on Fulfil to request an ASIN to be purged with a reason code that uniquely identifies that this is not a recall or other quality issue (so it can be restowed in manual shelving if desired)```\n\nRe 2 - Like Sam said in his follow up message, no bots were dispatched and nothing at all impacted operators - it immediately shorted and closed.\n\nIt is up to the Amazon team to assess the results of the inventory report to place orders with inventory that exists to minimize shorts. However, they have communicated to me it is Amazon's intentional strategy to not pay attention to availability, just total quantities, in hope things may come available.\n\ncc <@U0105PTF3E2|Michael Lobato> please check my work",

  "My gut reaction is that it is too much and we should just say it failed or not, they have no obligation to know our specific error codes",
  "I dont think we gave them one, so its probably worth communicating why the time changed from 5 seconds to 5 minutes and then pitch them to change it",
  "And we never agreed on a number that I can tell",
  "I think we set the expectation that it was way smaller earlier, so now its way larger. If we think this is a reasonable time, we should communicate that to them to update their alarms",

  "How to search production orders in Grafana\n\n1. Go here: <https://grafana.fulfil-api.com/d/b47a503b-0647-4646-bd47-a049569aa4e5/az-prod-logs?orgId=1> (Dashboards > Amazon > AZ Prod Logs)\n2. In the search, look up the Fulfil Order ID\n3. Scroll down to API call logs on the left, find the POST to partner/v1/orders (the order placement call) and find external_order_id (the amazon order ID)\n4. Replace the Fulfil Order ID w Amazon Order ID to get the best view\n\nTo check for order quantity and shorts\n1. Look at the order placement call. It will contain \n    a. Product code (ASIN)\n    b. Quantity for each\n    c. Allowed substitutions in an array. If array is empty, no substitutions allowed\n2. Look at the response - Partner API will return the ASINs and quantities sent to factory\n3. Scroll through the events on the side OR add in the second search field \"shorted\", you will see shorted events (see image)",

  "Hmmm probably. <@U0105PTF3E2|Michael Lobato> / <@U013TF1F70W|tim> / <@U015EQS4HT4|Zach Boone> - theres probably something here on how we identify invalid trayfits.\n\nCan you think of how to resolve the situation above\n\n1. Amazon uses product overrides to change a product from ambient to frozen\n2. Tony's code identifies that the current ambient product is on a tongue and changes it to a frozen tongue\n3. The code realizes that for the given lane size, frozen tongues are not available, and thus there is no valid tray fit for that configuration\n\nDo we\n• have tonys code change accept the change to the trayfit, then mark it invalid, and we communicate it somehow (emit a new event called invalid product override?)\n• somehow precalculate this and reject at catalog sync?\n• Something else",

  "<@UNFQUGUS3|Tony> thanks for calling this out.\n\nThere is a reality that we are allowing partners to chose storage environments for different products and to change them. My belief on how this should be structurally handled is\n\n• Trayfit should require a Tongue\n• Tongue Type (Ambient or Frozen) is determined by storage environment",
